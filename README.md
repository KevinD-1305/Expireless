Expireless A Final Year Project.

Expireless is a Final Year Porject built around the problem of food waste and trying to help people reduce their food waste by allowing them to keep track of their items and plan better.

Expireless is an Android based application that allows users to scan barcodes of their groceries, save their expiration dates and store them all in a database. Users will then be able to get frequent notifications of when certain items are close to expiring to serve as a reminder to use their food before its too late!
